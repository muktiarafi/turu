//! AQW build: parallel command encoding.
//!
//! wgpu records render passes cheaply and does the expensive work (validation, resource
//! tracking, and the driver's own command recording) in `CommandEncoder::finish`. Crowded AQW
//! scenes record 1000-2000+ passes per frame, all in one encoder, so `finish` ran on one core.
//!
//! Instead, the frame's single command stream is cut into consecutive segments between render
//! passes; at submit time all segments are finished in parallel and submitted, in recording
//! order, in the same `queue.submit`. The GPU receives exactly the same commands in the same
//! order, within the same frame.
