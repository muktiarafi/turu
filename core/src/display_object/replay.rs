//! AQW build (Mugetsu): frame interpolation's in-between pictures, drawn without walking the
//! display list again.
//!
//! Between two SWF frames nothing changes but how far the picture is between them, so every
//! in-between picture has the same commands, except for the transforms of the objects that
//! move. The first picture after a frame (or after something visible changed: an event, a
//! script) walks the display list as usual and records how each command was made (a
//! `Recorder`); the next ones (`Program::replay`) only blend the moving objects' transforms
//! again, and draw a few kinds of objects again as the walk would ("islands": shape tweens,
//! text, cached layers, masked objects), as they depend on more than their transform. The
//! commands come out the same as a walk's (checked by comparing both while developing it).
